      <h1 class="heading">Dashashwamedh Ghat</h1>
      <p class="place-description">Dashashwamedh Ghat is the main ghat in Varanasi on the Ganga River in Uttar Pradesh. It is located close to Vishwanath Temple and is probably the most spectacular ghat. Two Hindu legends are associated with it:
        according to one, Brahma created it to welcome Shiva, and in another, Brahma sacrificed ten horses during Dasa-Ashwamedha yajna performed here.

        The present ghat was built by Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao in the year 1748. A few decades later, Ahilyabahi Holkar, the Queen of Indore rebuilt the ghat in the year 1774.[1] Close to the ghat, overlooking the Ganga lies the Jantar Mantar, an
        observatory built by Maharaja Jai Singh of Jaipur in the year 1737.</p>
      <p class="place-description">
        Ganga Aarti (ritual of offering prayer to the Ganges river) is held daily at dusk. Several priests perform this ritual by carrying deepam and moving it up and down in a rhythmic tune of bhajans.[2] Special aartis are held on Tuesdays and on
        religious festivals.

        The Ganga Aarti starts soon after sunset and lasts for about 45 minutes. In summer the Aarti begins at about 7pm due to late sunsets and in winter it starts at around 6pm. Hundreds of people gather at the ghat every evening to watch the
        event..
        Dashashwamedh ghat is one of the oldest, most spectacular and important ghat, located at the bank of the river Gange near to the old Vishwanath Temple in the Kashi. The literal meaning of the Dashashwamedh is the Ghat (river front) of the ten
        sacrificed horses (dash means 10, ashwa means horse, medh means sacrifice).
      </p>
      <p class="place-description">
        There are two mythologies about the ghat is that the Lord Brahma was created the Dashashwamedh ghat in order to welcome the Lord Shiva, and the second one is the Lord Brahma was sacrificed the ten horses in a yajna here. The Dashashwamedh
        ghat was reconstructed by the Bajirao Pesava I in the year 1740 AD. It was later reconstructed by the Queen of the Indore (the princess Ahilyabai Holkar) in the year 1774.

        It is also believed that the ten horse sacrifice was done by the Bhara Shiva Naga rulers in the second century. This ghat is famous for the Agni Pooja which is held here daily in the evening by a group of the priest who are dedicated to the
        Lord Shiva, River Ganges, Surya, Agni as well as the whole universe. Tourists can see the excellent and colorful riverfront view. A group of sadhus can be seen performing religious activities at this ghat.</p>
      <p class="place-description">It is great to see the real attraction of this ghat in the evening when Gange aarti is held here. This ghat has become the religious spot for the devotees and pilgrims for years and tourists as well. Historically,
        it is considered as the most favorite and main ghat among the Hindu devotees. Near to the Dashashwamedh ghat, there are various religious temples as well as touristsâ€™ destinations.
      </p>
      <p class="place-description">At the great festivals, Hindu devotees come in huge number because of the different religious significance of the ghat. The ghat has retained its beauty with the various Hindu God temples and religious sites.
        Pilgrims come here to perform a variety of rituals and religious activities. The evening Aarti of the Gange at this ghat attracts huge crowd from every corner of the city. Some of the devotees come here daily in the morning to pay homage to
        their Lord after having a holy bath in the Gange water.</p>
