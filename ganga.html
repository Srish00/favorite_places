      <p class="place-description">Ganga Aarti is an important ritual held on a grand scale every morning and evening on the banks of the holy Ganges. The priests perform the Aarti at Dashashwamedh Ghat. The entire Ghat gets illuminated with a divine
        light that can be felt strongly. The magnificent ritual involves huge brass lamps lit with oil and the priests chant the holy mantras that reverberate in the entire location.</p>
      <p class="place-description">
        Ganga Aarti (ritual of offering prayer to the Ganges river) is held daily at dusk. Several priests perform this ritual by carrying deepam and moving it up and down in a rhythmic tune of bhajans.[2] Special aartis are held on Tuesdays and on
        religious festivals.

        The Ganga Aarti starts soon after sunset and lasts for about 45 minutes. In summer the Aarti begins at about 7pm due to late sunsets and in winter it starts at around 6pm. Hundreds of people gather at the ghat every evening to watch the
        event.

        he aarti is always carried out facing the River Ganga. A lot of lamps are lit during the aarti. They are usually circled out by priests. It is always done clockwise. The aarti is always accompanied by different songs sung while praising the
        Ganga. It is believed that the lamps acquire the power of the deity.

        After the aarti, devotees are supposed to cup their hands on the lamps over the flames and touch their foreheads. This is done in order to receive gratification and purification from the Goddess Ganga.

      <p class="place-description">India is a mystical land. It has a lot of places to explore and it can be called as a travellerâ€™s delight. One of the amazing part about this country is that you can travel from one town to another and find people
        with different cultural beliefs. There are various rituals in India and one of the strong and intense rituals is that of the Ganga Aarti.

        Every evening Ganga Aarti is carried out in three holy cities of India. They are Haridwar, Rishikesh and Varanasi. All three of them have different vibes and energies. It is said that you should be a part of all the three aartis once in a
        lifetime.

        A group of young saints dressed up with silky saffron and white robes conduct this ceremony. Each pandit or saint takes up a specific spot in the Ghat and start the ritual by offering flowers to the river. The ritual includes many oil lamps
        like snake hood lamp which are waved in a synced motion.</p>
