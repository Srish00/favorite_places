      <h1 class="heading">Ramnagar Fort</h1>
      <p class="place-description">The Ramnagar Fort is a fortification in Ramnagar, Varanasi, India. It is located near the Ganges on its eastern bank, opposite to the Tulsi Ghat. The sandstone structure was built in the Mughal style in 1750 by
        Kashi Naresh Raja Balwant Singh. At present, the fort is not in a good shape. The current king and the resident of the fort is Anant Narayan Singh, who is also known as the Maharaja of Varanasi even though this royal title has been abolished
        since 1971.</p>
      <p class="place-description">
        The fort is at a scenic location on the eastern right bank of the Ganges River, opposite to the Varanasi Ghats. It is 14 kilometres (8.7 mi) from Varanasi and 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) from the Benares Hindu University by the newly built Ramnagar
        bridge. With the bridge built it hardly takes 10 minutes to reach the fort from BHU. Boat ride to the fort from Dashashwamedh Ghat in Varanasi takes about an hour.[citation needed] A painted state barge with a twin emblems in the form of
        horses could be seen moored to the landing stage.[3] There is a well laid out garden within the fort which forms the approach to the palace.</p>
      <p class="place-description">
        The fort has been built on high ground, which is above the flood level.[7] The fort has many carved balconies, open courtyards and pavilions.[5] Only a part of the structure is open for public viewing as the rest of it is the residence of
        Kashi Naresh and his family. The flag on the fort is raised when the Maharaja is in residence in his palace fort.[1] Within the fort, the palace has two white towers, which are accessed by a flight of steps. At the end of the flight of steps,
        there is an archway and many courtyards that lead to the white tower.[3] The private residence of the Maharaja is on one side of the tower while the Durbar Hall and reception rooms are on the other side. An inscription on the fort wall
        attests "Fortified House of the Rajah of Benares, with his state Boat".</p>
      <p class="place-description">The museum is known as Saraswati Bhawan. The museum is in what used to be the Durbar Hall or the Public Audience Hall of the fort.[5] It is well known for its unusual and rare collections of American vintage cars,
        bejeweled sedan chairs, ivory work, medieval costumes, gold and silver brocaded royal Palakis (Palanquins in the shape of a lotus flower). It has elephant saddles carved out of silver, jewellery, costumes made of kimkhwa silk (finest product
        of the weavers of Varanasi), an impressive armoury hall with swords, old guns from Africa, Burma and Japan. The old armoured matchlocks, ornate hookahs, daggers, portraits of Maharajas, black musical instruments which have turned white
        because of neglect of maintenance and there is a rare astronomical clock.[2] This clock shows not only the time but also the year, month, week and day, and the astronomical details of the Sun, Moon and other planets.

      <p class="place-description">The fort palace appears very vibrant and colourful when beatified during the one-month-long Ram Lila festival where different episodes of Ramayana are enacted. On this occasion, a colourful pageant or procession of
        Ramayana epic is presented as part of the Dussehra celebrations that is held in October under the patronage of the Maharaja. These celebrations are concluded on the last day, the Dashami day (10th day of bright half of Lunar month) as per
        Hindu Calendar (October as per Gregorian Calendar, with the burning of the effigy of Ravana, the demon king, and his associates, which signifies victory of good over evil. The festival also includes a procession of various antique displays of
        Royal possessions.</p>
