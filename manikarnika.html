      <h1 class="heading">Manikarnika Ghat-Breaking the Cycle of Death and Rebirth</h1>
      <p class="place-description">Often referred to as the ‘the burning ghat’, Manikarnika Ghat is the main cremation ground of
        Banaras and is quite unlike anywhere else in India. At any one time there may be up to a dozen
        pyres burning here, with a seemingly constant stream of newly arrived corpes bound in cloth and
        strapped to a cane stretcher waiting to be cremated.</p>
      <p class="place-description">
        If you’re reading this expecting to be presented with close-up shots of the cremations,
        I’m afraid you will be disappointed. At the best of times I am always hesitant to point
        the camera directly at people during my travels, so the thought of photographing the funeral of a
        loved one is not something I am remotely interested in
        There is just so much to take in at this ghat, it’s almost impossible to put into words.
        On my first visit I stopped to watch proceedings from a short distance away.
      </p>
      <p class="place-description">
        In the space of under a minute the following happened; five tiny puppies playfully tugged at my shoelaces,
        three cremations were underway to my left, a cow, goat and two people ritually bathing directly in front
        of me, a man repairing a boat to my right, a recently married couple having their wedding blessed by the Ganga
        also to my right, a man standing on my left trying to sell me opium, another man standingon my right trying to
        sell me a ride on his boat.

        Where else on this planet could one be subjected to such a long list of diverse experiences in just 60 seconds ?</p>
      <p class="place-description">It might seem a little strange to say this, but the cremation ground didn’t strike as a particularly sad place. Hindus come to Banaras from all over India to die, and it is not a feared death. A death in Kashi is
        liberation (moksha), a release from the worldly cycle of reincarnation. The atmosphere is a strange one though, of almost casual solemnity.

        The deceased body arrives at Manikarnika Ghat having been carried though the serpentine-like narrow lanes of the Chauk district of Banaras. It is dipped in the Ganga for one last time before being lifted up on to the pyre.

      </p>
      <p class="place-description">Clarified butter (ghee) is smeared on the wood, in the old days ghee was also used to fill the body before burning. Sandalwood powder is poured over the shrouded corpse, I presume this is to cancel out some of the
        smell from burning.

        Dressed in white, the eldest son walks around the deceased before lighting the pyre. Wailing, crying, or showing any sign of mourning is considered bad luck for the dead. The rest of the funeral party stands nearby, as heavy wood is placed on
        top of the body. This is important as heat can cause muscles to contract which could result in the body to sitting up. Bamboo sticks are used to ensure the body is broken down in the fire.</p>
